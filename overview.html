         <h1>Reflection</h1> 
         <br>My project is a made through Pygame, a Python module. Python is somewhat
         similar to the previous Pyret, which is the programming language learned
         in the previous unit. A large difference from what I learned through the creation
         of this game and the previous unit is the format of the project. This project
         is a game whilst the Pyret projects were all related to data science. The
         project is also related to the first unit I learned in computer science, which
         is Snap. Snap and Python are very different languages, but they are both
         used by me to make games.</br>
         <br>The outcome of my project is somewhat satisfactory, the result was
         better then I have expected. There are many more details I could have
         added to the project that would make it much better, but it is already
         quite up to my standars as an introductory project. The project aproximately
         met the original goal I set, expect there were alot of details (such as
         music) that I was unable to add.</br>
         <div><h3>Career Paths</h3></div>
         <br>This newely learned skill opens the career path towards
         becoming a programmer. The skill is not necesarily tailor only
         towards becoming a game maker, as the knowledge learned through the
         unit can be applied to many other aspects of computer science.</br>
         <div><h3>Tools, and Process</h3></div>
         <br>The visual novel is programmed on Pycharm using Python and Pygame.
         Other tools can be found on the resources page. The process of creating
         the game consits of:</br>
         <ol>
            <li>Watching Pygame tutorials on Youtube</li>
            <li>Gathering all the assets for the project</li>
            <li>Coding all the different scenes</li>
            <li>Adding all the scenes together</li>
         </ol>
